\usage{
default_params_doc(
  assays,
  disease_names,
  host_organism_iris,
  mhc_restriction,
  offset,
  order,
  query,
  select,
  source_organism_iris,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{assays}{one or more assays.
Possible values are "B Cell", "MHC Ligand" and "T Cell",
as these are the names used at \url{http://www.iedb.org/}}

\item{disease_names}{disease names.
Possible value is "healthy"}

\item{host_organism_iris}{the host.
Possible value is "NCBITaxon:9606", which denotes Homo sapiens}

\item{mhc_restriction}{MHC restriction
Possible values are "Any", "Class I",
"Class II", "Non-classical" and a haplotype name}

\item{offset}{the offset of the results from a query,
as checked by \link{check_offset}.
A standard query uses an offset of zero
and returns maximally \code{10000} results.
To obtain the next results, an \code{offset} of \code{10000}
is used.}

\item{order}{the item by which the query is ordered,
as checked by \link{check_order}.
For bigger queries (i.e. with more than 10k results),
\code{order} is important to obtain each 10k set of results in
the same manner.}

\item{query}{an IEDB query,
as created by, for example, \link{create_healthy_human_query}.
Use \link{check_query} to check if the \code{query} is valid}

\item{select}{the fields that the query returns,
as checked by \link{check_select}}

\item{source_organism_iris}{the epitope source.
Possible value is "NCBITaxon:9606", which denotes Homo sapiens}

\item{structure_type}{structure of the epitope,
as checked by \link{check_structure_type}.
Possible values are "Linear peptide",
as these are the names used at \url{http://www.iedb.org/}}

\item{verbose}{set to \link{TRUE} for more output}

This function does nothing. It is intended to inherit is parameters'
documentation.
}
\note{
This is an internal function, so it should be marked with
\code{@noRd}. This is not done, as this will disallow all
functions to find the documentation parameters
